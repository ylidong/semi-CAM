# semi-CAM
A semi-supervised deconvolution method for bulk transcriptomic data with partial marker gene information

# Tutorial

##Input data: \

1. Gene expression data of mixture samples. semi-CAM can take around 10 mixtures, if have more than 15 mixtures, dimension reduction methods such as hierarchical clustering methods need to be applied on the data first. 

2. Markers for partial/all cell types. The algorithm takes markers for at least one cell type, up to markers for all number of cell types in the mixtures.

3. Number of cell types in the mixtures.
